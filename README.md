# tidyINEGI

`tidyINEGI` is an open-source R package that allows users to
programatically load analysis-ready [INEGI](https://www.inegi.org.mx/)
data sets into R and in other formats (.dta, .xlsx).

Why tidy? Other packages are not user friendly and are not
collaborative, they are not alive.

Why analysis-ready? Frequent users of INEGI data sets ought to know how
painful it is to get raw data from INEGI into a working state, with
variable and value labels. This package aims to bridge that gap,
providing transparent documentation and inviting users to contribute.

## Development

`tidyINEGI` is at an early stage of development. Current work is focused
on [ENIGH](https://www.inegi.org.mx/programas/enigh/nc/2022/). No
development version is available just yet.

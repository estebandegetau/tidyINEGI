# tidyINEGI

`tidyINEGI` is an open-source R package that allows users to programatically load analysis-ready INEGI data sets into R and in other formats (.dta, .xlsx). 

Why tidy? Other packages are not user friendly and are not collaborative, they are not alive.

Why analysis-ready? Frequent users of INEGI data sets ought to know how painful it is to get from raw data into workable data. This package aims to bridge that gap, providing transparent documentation and inviting users to contribute. This is a live project, unlike importinegi.

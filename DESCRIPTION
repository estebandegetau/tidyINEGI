Title: Access Analysis-Ready Data From [INEGI]("https://www.inegi.org.mx/")
Version: 0.1.0
Description: An open-source R package that allows users to programatically load
    analysis-ready INEGI data sets into R and in other formats (.dta, .xlsx).
    Why analysis-ready? Frequent users of INEGI data sets ought to know how 
    painful it is to get from raw data into workable data. This package aims to
    bridge that gap, providing transparent documentation and inviting users to
    contribute.
